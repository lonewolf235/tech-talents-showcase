    "summary": "I'm an AI/ML Engineer at Tata Consultancy Services, specializing in Generative AI, Agentic Systems, and LLMOps. With expertise spanning NLP, Computer Vision, and MLOps, I design and deploy production-scale AI solutions that handle massive datasets and real-time inference. My technical arsenal includes FastAPI, LangChain, HuggingFace, and cloud-native observability tools. I've architected AI systems that improve operational efficiency by 30% while maintaining enterprise-grade security and compliance standards. Beyond coding, I believe in reproducible coffee over magic – bringing the same systematic approach to both model development and my morning brew routine.",
